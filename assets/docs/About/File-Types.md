# Filetypes and applications

`*.FCStd` files are the native format of [FreeCAD](https://www.freecadweb.org/), an open-source 3D parametric modeller. It has a GUI to manipulate and parametrize models. For assemblies of several models, we use the [Assembly4 workbench](https://wiki.freecadweb.org/Assembly4_Workbench). Interlocks for laser-cutting were generated with the rudimentary but functional [LCInterlocking workbench](https://github.com/execuc/LCInterlocking).

`*.pro` is a project file for the OSS [KiCAD EDA](https://www.kicad-pcb.org/), an open-source electronics design automation suite. KiCad can produce `*.gbr` RS-274X gerber files for the manufacturers, even though some manufacturers accept KiCAD project files by now.

`*.scad` files are the native file format of [OpenSCAD](https://www.openscad.org/), "The Programmers Solid 3D CAD Modeller" â€“ another open-source software (OSS). It uses a scripting language to build parametric models.

`*.[stp|step]` files are a 3D exchange format ([STEP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_10303-21)). They can be opened and edited with different application, for example [FreeCAD](https://www.freecadweb.org/).

`*.stl` are "stereolithography" files, containing unstructured triangulated surfaces of 3D models. This is the output format understood by our 3D printers, but not good for editing.

`*.svg` 2D Designs for laser cut, can be edited in the OSS [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/). Sometimes `*.dxf` is used as an export format. To download these files, you might need to click on the `raw` button and then save the file.

`*.[iam|ipt|idw]` files are the file format of [Autodesk Inventor](http://autodesk.com/inventor), a proprietary and commercial 3D CAD software. The extensions represent assembly, part, and drawing files respectively: `*.idw` files are "Inventor Drawing files", `*.ipt` files are "Inventor Part files", `*.iam` files are "Inventor Assembly files" ([Autodesk Inventor](https://www.autodesk.com/products/inventor/overview)).

`*.pdf` files are used for different purposes. Within 3D projects, they sometimes contain drawings of the parts.

`*.[md|mdown]` is the documentation. The `mdown` files are meant as readme files on the [GitHub project](https://github.com/reiserlab/Fly-Lab-Gear), the md files are rendered into the website at <https://reiserlab.github.io/Fly-Lab-Gear/>

`*.[jpg|png]` pictures of the produced items. Sometimes they follow the filename pattern `<design>_<printer>_<nr>_<date>`.
