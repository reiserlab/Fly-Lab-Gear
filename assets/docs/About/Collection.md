# [Inexpensive Treadmill Experiments]({{site.baseurl}}/inexpensive-treadmill)

[![Title page of manuscript]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/Collection/10.3389_fnbeh.2021.689573.png){: .ifr}]({{site.baseurl}}/inexpensive-treadmill)

[The "Inexpensive Treadmill" collection]({{site.baseurl}}/inexpensive-treadmill) shows all parts used in the article "An Inexpensive, High-Precision, Modular Spherical Treadmill Setup Optimized for *Drosophila* Experiments". Updates to and comments on the paper are published here as well.

## [Step-by-step guide to building an Inexpensive Treadmill]({{site.baseurl}}/how-to-build-inexpensive-treadmill)

An undergraduate student replicated the Inexpensive Treadmill setup at home using her own 3D printer. She documented the steps she took in this easy-to-follow [step-by-step guide]({{site.baseurl}}/how-to-build-inexpensive-treadmill).

# [Printing a Fly Pyramid]({{site.baseurl}}/how-to-print-a-fly-pyramid)

We are actively developing a [Fly Pyramid]({{site.baseurl}}/physiology/flypyramid) that is 3D printable in an inexpensive resin printer. The article [Printing a Fly Pyramid]({{site.baseurl}}/how-to-print-a-fly-pyramid) shows the printer, resin, and slicer settings we are currently using for our best results. Consider this work in progress and please share your settings, especially if they differ from ours.
