# Introduction 

The fly spoon is an accessory model used in imaging experiments with Drosophila melanogaster. This version of the fly holder is meant to be printed with a resin printer with the provided model supports. This edition of the fly spoon is optimized for customizability and parameterization for resin 3d printing. Drosophila, microscopes, and mounting equipment vary in size and shape, and will often cause necessary changes in the fly holder design. This model allows for a wide range of customization in design and accessibility.

The [current model of the Fly Spoon]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/Parametric-Fly-Holder/Fly_Spoon_Model.FCStd) was designed in a free, open source 3d modeling software called FreeCAD, which is available for all major platforms (Linux, Windows, and Mac). FreeCAD can be downloaded here: https://www.freecad.org/downloads.php This design was created in FreeCAD version 0.21.2, and made in the weekly version of FreeCAD, found here: Release weekly-builds · FreeCAD/FreeCAD-Bundle · GitHub To properly parameterize the model, any latest weekly version after version “38314” will work. However, due to unknown complications the parameterization of this model so far only works on Windows (Linux does not work with it). 

A tutorial to print the model and the best settings are shown at the end of the document. The FreeCAD file(.FCstd), which can be used to parameterize the model, cannot be directly printed. Instead, the FreeCAD model needs to be exported either as an OBJ or as an STL, which will be shown at the end of the document.  Furthermore, the default OBJ and STL files, which cannot be parameterized and include only default settings, are also linked in the GitHub below. Both the OBJ and STL files, however, can be directly imported into a slicer to be 3d-printed. In general, stl files were used. However, in rare cases, the preferable STL format led to erroneous rendering in the Lychee slicer software. Switching to the OBJ file format solved this problem. In GitHub, both formats are provided to work around similar issues.

# Overview

The following documentation describes the parameters and customization of the Fly Spoon Model for application in various experiments. To change the following parameters, open the FreeCAD file and click on Fly Spoon Parameters near the top left. This will open a spreadsheet with a list of parameters and values as shown below. Values on a yellow background can be modified, red parameters are "read only” references that are calculated by the model and based on the modified parameters.

*ConeCount* (default: 15) defines the total number of cones supporting the entire model at the bottom. 


## Microscope 

This section and the stylized objective are only to be used as visualization, and should not be printed or exported into a slicer software. It is instead intended to provide a realistic prediction and image of how the microscope would look with the fly spoon and the possibility of its “intersecting” into the fly spoon with a particular working distance. 

![Microscope]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/Parametric-Fly-Holder/Spoon_Microscope.png){#fig-Spoon_Microscope .lightbox}

Changing this parameter and the *LensDiameter* (@sec-LensDiameter) parameter can cause the microscope to intersect with the fly spoon, indicating a collision in real life with those values. 

# Print Tutorial Recommended Resins and Exposure Times 

Test prints were conducted on the Elegoo Mars 3, Phrozen Sonic Mini 8k, and the Elegoo Saturn 3 Ultra, and all worked well with little difference between each. 

## Print Instructions 

### FreeCAD export instructions 

::: {#fig-Support layout-ncol=2}


![Switch to the *Mesh* workspace]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/Parametric-Fly-Holder/Spoon_FreeCAD_export01.png){#fig-Spoon_FreeCAD_export01 .lightbox}

![]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/Parametric-Fly-Holder/Spoon_FreeCAD_export02.png){#fig-Spoon_FreeCAD_export02 .lightbox}

![]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/Parametric-Fly-Holder/Spoon_FreeCAD_export03.png){#fig-Spoon_FreeCAD_export03 .lightbox}

FreeCAD export
:::

This can be skipped if FreeCAD is not being used to parameterize the model, and the default 3d files are being used.

After editing the parameters of the FreeCAD model, exit out to the main menu. Click on the dropdown on the top bar of the screen that says **Part Design** or **Start** under the **Windows** button, and change the dropdown menu to *Mesh*, as shown below in @fig-Spoon_FreeCAD_export01.

After this, select the *Fly Spoon Body* and *Supports* folders on the left, as seen below, and click on the *Create Mesh From Shape* option (see @fig-Spoon_FreeCAD_export02), and select the *Ok* button with the default settings (default settings were shown to work very well). 

After this, select all the new meshes and click the merge button, on the top toolbar, as shown in @fig-Spoon_FreeCAD_export03. 
 
With this final mesh, turn off the visibility of all the other objects to make sure that there are no glitches or holes in the design, and then right click on the final singular mesh and select *Export Mesh…* as a `*.stl` file. After this, the mesh objects can be deleted. 


## Slicer Setup Tutorial  

The slicer software being used is called [Lychee Slicer](https://mango3d.io/resin-sla-msla-3d-printers).

![Fly Spoon in the Lychee Slicer]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/Parametric-Fly-Holder/Spoon_Slicer.png){#fig-Spoon_Slicer .lightbox}

After setting up the settings of the printer in the software and importing the fly spoon (`*.stl` or `*.obj` file) model into the slicer. The fly spoons should be printed individually and not connected to each other, with the bottom supports laying on the plate. However, it is recommended that the fly spoons are printed relatively close to each other, to minimize possible damage from the sloshing of the liquid resin (this is not determined to be a big problem, but it is best to be safe). After this, export the model and print it. 


## Build Plate Removal 

After the prints are finished being printed, carefully remove the build plate from the printer, and lay it flat on the table. After this, use a small razor blade to scrape under the bottom supports near the back of the model, until the bottom supports are loose.  

After this, you can wash each of the prints, with either IPA or water (depending on the resin being used), and then cure it for around 5-10 minutes to solidify the resin. 


## Recommended Resins and Exposure Times 

Throughout the course of printing fly spoons, it was tested on. No tests were specifically done on the fly spoons to measure their strength and effectiveness and resin. However, around 60 tests, with different resins, bottom thicknesses, and top thicknesses, were conducted on a similar fly holder model, known as the Fly Pyramid. The information on the strength of these models, which were 3D printed for similar applications and in a similar fashion, can be found under the [Fly Pyramid Documentation](fly-pyramid.qmd).

This documentation also includes information found on the specific exposure times and settings of the fly pyramid.
