M12 or S-mounts are often used in webcams and CCTV cameras. CCTV is also a good search term when looking for lenses. While the lens mount can be printed on a good 3D printer, it is often easier and cheaper to buy a lens mount when acquiring a lens. Nevertheless, here are two options:

This is the lens mount that can be used for an M12 lens on a PS3 Eye PCB. It has additional nibs that fit holes in the PS3 Eye PCB – not necessary but helpful for alignment. Glueing this directly on the PCB after taking apart the camera allows the use of standard M12 lenses while protecting the sensor. It also fits inside the standard PS3 Eye case.
