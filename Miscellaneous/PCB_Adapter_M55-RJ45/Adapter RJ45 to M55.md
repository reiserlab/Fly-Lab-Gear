For prototyping we needed an adapter from an RJ45 connector (standard network) to an [Harwin Archer M55](https://www.harwin.com/products/M55-6002042R/) with a specific mapping. This is the custom PCB for it.

## M55-RJ45 converter

Some of the arena panels are connected via 20 pin Archer M55 connectors. For a prototype, we wanted to transmit a subset from seven specific pins via ethernet cables. The M55-RJ45 project adapts specific M55 pins to the RJ45 pins.

| M55 pin(s) | RJ45 pin(s) |
| :---:      | :---:       |
| 6          | 3           |
| 11+12+14   | 2           |
| 13         | 5           |

The M55 and RJ45 connectors have pads on opposite sides of the PCB, and contain both versions for [male](https://www.digikey.com/short/zjdjrj) and [female](https://www.digikey.com/short/zjdjr1) M55 connectors. The rendering above shows the "f" (female) side of the PCB. For the [RJ45 connector](https://www.digikey.com/short/zjdjf8), we use a surface-mount only version.
