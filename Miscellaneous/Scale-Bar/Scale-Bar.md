A FreeCAD model of a scale bar that can be embedded in other assemblies to signify the size.

![Model of a 20mm scale bar]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/Miscellaneous/Scale-Bar/Scale-Bar.png){: .ifr .pop}
This scale bar has 1mm wide and 20mm long bars on each of the three cartesian axis. Each axis is colored differently. The first 10mm of an axis is in the axis color, the next 5mm in black, followed by alternating color/black pieces. This allows better estimation of subunits. This file is for integration into bigger assemblies and can be scaled according to the model size.
