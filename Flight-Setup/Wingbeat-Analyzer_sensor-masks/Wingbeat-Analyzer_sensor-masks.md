`Wingbeat-Analyzer_sensor-masks.svg`[<sup>a</sup>](#fna): In our setup, the optical wingbeat analyzer has a circular filter. In addition, to achieve an optimal shape of the shadow cast on the sensors, we use a mask. This file contains different shapes that we tested and that have different properties for the resulting measurements. These masks are laser-cut from opaque acrylic.
