abstract: "In this repository, we share a number of hardware designs that we developed for the published article 'An inexpensive, high-precision, modular spherical treadmill setup optimized for Drosophila experiments'. While writing this paper, we also started documenting previously developed components that we would like to share with other labs and researchers. And while we hope to improve these individual designs over time, we will use the repository as a supplementary file collection for other publications. Similarly, we also started a (non-exhaustive) link collection to interesting repositories, projects, and other publications."
